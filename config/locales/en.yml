  about: >
          An independently owned and operated company developed by a
          group of skateboarders brought together by one common interest.
          Skateboarding has shaped the perspectives of everyone involved
          in CASTE and acts as the foundation of the brand. CASTE operates
          to create products based on the influence of our continually
          expanding and diverse library of communicative mediums. Our
          attention to detail transcends from visual media into physical
          products that all share the same regards to quality.
